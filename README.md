## Community Structure

The platform includes three pre-configured communities:

1. **Tech Innovators Hub** - For technology enthusiasts and developers
2. **Environmental Action Group** - Focused on sustainability and environmental initiatives
3. **Business Leaders Network** - For entrepreneurship and business networking

## External Services

Third-party email services are utilised in order to perform email verification for changing an email address and registering an account. To test this feature, please make a new user or change an existing user's email address to test this feature.

## Authorisation System

UniHub implements a robust authorisation system to ensure platform security and content moderation:

1. **Community Approval Process**
   - All new communities require admin approval before becoming active
   - Admins review community details via the admin panel at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)
   - Communities remain in "inactive" state until explicitly approved

2. **User Access Levels**
   - Regular users: Can create content, join communities, and participate in events
   - Staff users: Can moderate content and access additional features
   - Admin users: Full system access including approving communities and managing all content

3. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Only community owners can manage community leaders and community settings
   - Community owners and leaders can create events for the community, and manage them
   - Community membership controls access to community-specific features
   - Event participation is controlled with capacity limits and join/leave permissions
   - Users can only delete their own posts or comments

4. **Safety Features**
   - Email verification required for account registration and email changes
   - User profile data is protected with user-specific edit permissions
   - JWT authentication with secure token management
   - CSRF protection with trusted origins configuration
   - Secure password management requiring verification for changes
   - Comprehensive data cleanup when users delete their accounts
